Smoked Pork and Green Chile Pozole

Brief history:
My dad, Jay Gardner, ordered green chile pozole at a nice mexican restaurant in
Phoenix, AZ called Sierra Bonita. He loved it and asked the chef for his recipe,
who obliged him with a basic sketch of how to make it. His first attempts
included things like using just chicken broth as a stock and experiments with
different seasonings. 

The big breakthrough was using a smoked turkey carcass (after thanksgiving, most
of the meat gone) to make the stock. He also relied on the local mexican market
for roasted green chiles until he started doing it himself. Later he experimented
with different chiles to test their heat level. He found that using different peppers
did not drastically change the flavor of the green chile sauce (some have slightly different
aftertastes), but some, like pasilla peppers, were much more consistent in spice
level. 

One important discovery is that many places that sell smoked pork intend it to
be used shredded, so they smoke it until the meat loses self-cohesion. This soup
is better with solid chunks of pork; the shredded pork leads to a more
homogenous texture, while with the chunks, you get nice big pieces of meat.

One note is that this recipe is always changing; my dad experiments with
different things. One year he just used ham chunks instead of pork shoulder
because he couldn't afford the latter. It wasn't quite as good, but it was still
good. There are also a few tricks he hasn't taught me; he wants to keep some
things secret. They are minor, and possibly WIP features. 

Good luck. It can be a lot of work, especially the first time, but the most time
consuming part (other than boiling the broth or smoking the pork, which don't
require attention) is roasting the peppers and chiles. This can take a half hour
to an hour.
